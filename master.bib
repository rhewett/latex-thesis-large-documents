  abstract = {A microscopic diffusional theory for the motion of a curved antiphase
	boundary is presented. The interfacial velocity is found to be linearly
	proportional to the mean curvature of the boundary, but unlike earlier
	theories the constant of proportionality does not include the specific
	surface free energy, yet the diffusional dissipation of free energy
	is shown to be equal to the reduction in total boundary free energy.
	The theory is incorporated into a model for antiphase domain coarsening.
	Experimental measurements of domain coarsening kinetics in Fe-Al
	alloys were made over a temperature range where the specific surface
	free energy was varied by more than two orders of magnitude. The
	results are consistent with the theory; in particular, the domain
	coarsening kinetics do not have the temperature dependence of the
	specific surface free energy.},
